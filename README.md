# Titanic
Machine Learning Models for Predicting Survival of Titanic Passengers

### File List
1. README.md - a file with project information
2. gender_submission.csv - passenger gender
3. main.ipynb - the working file
4. test.csv - test data for machine learning model
5.. train.csv - training data for machine learning model

### Results
1. The original data was analyzed. Handling of missing values, identification of useful categorical data, removal of outliers, and data normalization were performed.
2. Several machine learning algorithms were implemented: decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine. Additionally, a neural network model based on the PyTorch library was implemented.
3. All models performed well on the task (with 70% - 81% accuracy). The support vector machine performed the best, while the neural network performed the worst. To improve the neural network's performance, it is recommended to experiment with architecture changes.
